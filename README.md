## 🐩 How to Submit Homework  🐈 

### Push Your code Regularly 

1.  Using that week's homework folder on your forked version of Github, push your changes to your repository from your terminal by changing into your repository from your terminal and running the following commands:
  
  * `git add -A`
  * `git commit -m "current week homework”`
  * `git push`

2.  Create a github `Issue` in your homework repository 
  * See the dropdown below:

3. Finally, fill out this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/4NPb21sHPtbvKSYD6) with your github link for that specific homework. It will be the same Google Form for each homework.

💡**Pro Tip**: Commit your work every time you hit a milestone, as often as possible. This is the versioning history of your entire project. 


## 🛑 Plagiarism 🛑

- Plagiarism (passing someone else's off as your own) will only result in you getting job that you're unqualified for and will get fired from
	- How do I know?
		- What is it?
			- copying another student's code
			- copying another student's code and altering it to look like yours
			- copying a solution to a homework question, lab, or project that you found online
			- copying a solution to a homework question, lab, or project that you found online and altering it to look like yours
		- What is it not?
			- finding syntax online that will help you build the solution that you came up with
			- asking another student to debug your code or help you work with your own solution.  Note, this is not "what did you get for question 1?"
		- How to stay safe
			- Come up with your own idea about how to solve the problem and find syntax online to help you create it
			- Do not try to find the answer to how to solve the problem online or get it from another student
			- If you use a chunk of code that is more than a few lines long, even if you alter it, cite it with a comment in your code.  Give either a link to the site or the student that gave it to you.  If what you're citing is the vast majoritiy of your solution, it's probably plagiarized
	- Your employers will quickly discover that you don't know what you say you know
	- If you feel you can't complete the work, come to your instructors and we can figure out a way for you to turn in something meaningful.  There is always a solution
	- You can usually receive a partial refund or continue in another course if withdrawing for family/external issues.  Not for plagiarism.  Come to us before doing anything extreme
	- Even if you succeed in making us believe you are responsible for plagiarized work, ultimately, when you graduate, you will have only a meaningless certificate and none of the knowledge to back it up
